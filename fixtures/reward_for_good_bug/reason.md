# Why bugs reports are rewarded?

Every bug reported and accepted deserves a reward, which
are given to the reporter of the bug. A bug is considered as
"accepted" only if it has the `bug`, `enhancement`, or `question` label
attached to it. Such a reward encourages programmers to report
more bugs, thus revealing problems that will be fixed before they
are shipped to a customer.
